# What is the goad of presentation?

Here you have everything you hard.
```
1. To inform the people
2. To convince people
3. To get by in
4. To make excitement
5. Having impact
etc.
```

In a room there are 10 or more people. What is the asked you gonna convince the people. They are gonna remember what you say?

*If you think about it, everything we talk about is the goal of a good presentation setting up a failure. 
Because we know it does not work to convince all the people. *Because no one is showing us an alternative.*

If the group of the people is talking to you after the work that means you're gonna create a curiosity. 
And curiosity is the goal of presentation.

```
Curiosity Is The Goal Of Presentation.
```

**Whether it's 10 minutes or 1 hours long if you can make people curious, that is a successful presentation. 
And that is the goal of the every presentation.**
