# First Few Minutes

## Opening Presentation

```
Uncertainty equal Interest
```

We have to opening there are first unrelated to the topic. And after few sentences we will back to the topic for creating curiosity.
Summarize the presentation. But what is the last sentence of closing presentation? Best closing is refer to the opening. ;) That make to a impact full closing.

```
Best Opening presentation is talking to a Uncertainty topic.
Then few sentences back to the topic.
Refer to the opening.
```


## Problem Identification

**You wanna be able to say one sentence that gonna be people quickly identify and empathy with the problem.**

## Presenting Solutions

**Emagine**

## Transitioning between ideas and sections

How to we jump between all the various presentation? We use **TRANSITION STATEMENT**.

Here we will talk two different version.
1. Now...
2. Lets...

```
Now the talk about A.
Lets the talk about B.
```

But if we use every transition using this two word that's not a good sign. So, We don't need to talk details in every section and we have to use different transition. Example, **Now... the next question is.**. Finding your own rhetorical question.
